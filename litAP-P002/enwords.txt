French President Emmanuel Macron said he "respected" Donald Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord but that France would remain committed.

"On climate we know what our differences are," Mr Macron said in Paris on Thursday, adding that it was important to move forward.

Speaking alongside Mr Macron, Mr Trump then hinted that the US could shift its position but failed to elaborate.

"Something could happen with respect to the Paris accord," he said.

Mr Trump added: "We'll see what happens."

The US president withdrew from the 2015 Paris climate agreement last month, citing moves to negotiate a new "fair" deal that would not disadvantage US businesses.

Mr Macron said it was right to put the climate issue to one side while the two leaders discussed how they could work together on other matters such as the ceasefire in Syria and trade partnerships.

"We have disagreements; Mr Trump had election pledges that he took to his supporters and I had pledges - should this hinder progress on all issues? No," Mr Macron said.

Mr Macron and Mr Trump then talked about their countries' joint efforts to combat terrorism and in particular the so-called Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq.

"The US is extremely involved in the Iraq war," Mr Macron said, "I would like to thank the president for everything done by American troops in this area".

"We've agreed to continue our joint work," he added, "in particular building the post-war roadmap".

Mr Macron said that France would seek to "undertake several robust initiatives" to help produce greater stability and "control over the region"
